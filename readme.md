# R-Expressions

R-Expressions or Rich Expressions is a markup language inspired by S-Expressions
and M-Expressions. It's toolkit written with JavaScript and could be used
anywhere on server, desktop, and browser.

## Example

```
(pseudo-lang ^1.0)

Console.log('Hello, world!')
; Which is the same
Stream.write(Process.stdout 'Hello, world\n')
```
