# R-Expressions

R-expressions or Rich Expressions is a markup language inspired by S-
and M-expressions. It's toolkit written with JavaScript. Toolkit contains tokenizer, parser, traverser, and transformer. Tokenizer and parser support streaming mode and could be used for REPL creation.

## Application

R-expressions could be used for:

1. Lisp-like programming languages creation.
2. Language prototyping.
3. Transpiler creation.

## Example

```
(pseudo-lang ^1.0)

import((Console) from io)

Console.log('Hello, %s!' 'World')
```

## Types

R-Expressions contains symbols, strings, lists, calls and comments.

### Symbol

Symbol is a sequence of characters without whitespaces, single quotes or parenthesis.
While whitespace, semicolon, quote or open parenthesis could be escaped by backslash.

These are all symbols:
```
true
1_000_000
^1.*
Console.log

<node>
```


### String

String is value surrounded by single quotes `'`. Single quote within a string should be escaped with a backslash `\`. And backslash could be escaped by another backslash `\\`.

```
'This is a string'
'Hello! I\'m a string too.'
```

### Lists

List is a type which can contain other types symbols, strings, lists, and calls:

R-expressions has three types of lists round, square, and figure, this lists
are enclosed with round, square, or figure parenthesis respectively.

```
(null true 1_234 'Hello')
```

### Call

Call is a type which specifies function call and is presented by symbol followed by a list:

```
print('Hello world')
```

Calls could be chained:

```
curry(print 'Hello, %s')('World')
; or
print('Hello, %s' ?)('World')
```

Lists could be mixed:
```
div{class: ('badge' 'badge-round' 'badge-red')}(
  p('Users count: ' 1)
)
```

### Comment

Comment is a line of text prepended with a semicolon `;`. Comment ends with new line char `\n`.

```
; Hi! I'm a comment. I can help you to describe your program
```
